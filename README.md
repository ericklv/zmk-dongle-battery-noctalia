# ZMK Dongle Battery for Noctalia

Noctalia bar widget that shows the battery level of each half of a ZMK split keyboard driven by a USB dongle. It reads the levels from the dongle over ZMK Studio RPC, so it works without a Bluetooth link between the host and the keyboard.

The bar shows `L 87% R 92%`. Clicking it opens a panel with the outline of each half and its level. A half at 20% or lower turns red.

## How it works

- `zmk_battery.py` opens the dongle's USB CDC ACM port (`/dev/serial/by-id/usb-ZMK_Project_*`) and speaks the Studio RPC framing.
- It finds the `zmk__battery_history` custom subsystem and sends `get_history`.
- Each half answers through the dongle with `BatteryHistoryNotification` messages. The script keeps the newest entry per source.
- The dongle sometimes drops relayed entries. The script repeats the request, up to 5 times by default, until every expected half has answered.
- Output is one JSON line on stdout.

The plugin has three entries:

| Entry | File | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reader` service | `service.luau` | Runs the script every 10 minutes, when the panel opens and from the refresh button, and publishes the result to the plugin state. |
| `bar` widget | `widget.luau` | Shows the levels in the bar and toggles the panel on click. |
| `panel` panel | `panel.luau` | Device chips, refresh button and the outline of each half. |

Levels are the latest entry each half recorded, not a live reading. How often the halves record depends on `CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_INTERVAL_MINUTES` and `CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_LEVEL_THRESHOLD`.

## Requirements

### Firmware

- **ZMK fork:** [cormoran's ZMK fork](https://github.com/cormoran/zmk) with the custom Studio protocol, for example the `main+dya` revision.
- **Module:** [zmk-module-battery-history](https://github.com/cormoran/zmk-module-battery-history).
- **Studio:** a dongle central with ZMK Studio over USB (`studio-rpc-usb-uart` snippet).
- **Kconfig:**

  | Board | Options |
  | --- | --- |
  | Dongle | `CONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y`, `CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY=y`, `CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_STUDIO_RPC=y`, `CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_RELAY_EVENT=y` |
  | Each half | `CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY=y`, `CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_RELAY_EVENT=y` |

  With `CONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_LOCKING=y` the dongle must be unlocked before it answers.

### Host

- Noctalia 5.4 or newer (plugin API 42).
- Python 3.10 or newer as `python3`. The script uses only the standard library and encodes the few Studio messages it needs by hand.
- Read and write access to `/dev/ttyACM*`. On Arch this means membership in the `uucp` group.

## Installation

Clone the repository into Noctalia's local plugin directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ericklv/zmk-dongle-battery-noctalia \
  ~/.local/share/noctalia/plugins/zmk_dongle_stats
noctalia msg plugins enable eleve/zmk_dongle_stats
```

Then add **ZMK Dongle Stats** to a bar from the widget picker, or by hand with `type = "eleve/zmk_dongle_stats:bar"`.

Force a read from the shell:

```sh
noctalia msg plugin eleve/zmk_dongle_stats:reader all refresh
```

## Command line

```sh
python3 zmk_battery.py
```

```json
{"ok": true, "name": "Eyelash Corne", "devices": ["Eyelash Corne"], "sides": [{"source": 1, "label": "L", "level": 87, "timestamp": 1}, {"source": 2, "label": "R", "level": 92, "timestamp": 1}], "error": null, "time": 1794263137}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--port PATH` | every `usb-ZMK_Project_*` port | Serial port to use. |
| `--device NAME` | first device that answers | USB product name, as `lsusb` shows it. |
| `--labels MAP` | `1=L,2=R` | Name for each source id. Swap it if the halves come out reversed. Source 0 is the dongle. |
| `--attempts N` | `5` | Requests before giving up on a missing half. |
| `--with-dongle` | off | Also report source 0. |

The exit code is `0` on success and `1` on error. Errors are reported in the `error` field.

## Multiple keyboards

The script tries every ZMK port and uses the first one that exposes battery history. When more than one is connected, the panel shows a chip for each USB product name. The selected name is stored in `device.txt` inside the plugin data directory (`~/.local/state/noctalia/plugins/data/eleve/zmk_dongle_stats/`) and passed as `--device`.

## Outlines

The panel outline is chosen by matching the USB product name, lowercased and stripped of non-alphanumeric characters, against these keys:

| Key | Traced from |
| --- | --- |
| `corne` | crkbd PCB |
| `sofle` | Sofle case |
| `totem` | TOTEM case |
| `lily58` | Lily58 case |

Unknown names fall back to `corne`. Every outline is tilted 5 degrees and stored as fractions of the half's width in `shapes.luau`. Noctalia plugins have no canvas, so the panel writes each outline as an SVG, colored from the active palette, to the `svg/` folder of the plugin data directory. The level is drawn at the center of the largest circle that fits inside each outline.

## Limitations

- The serial port is opened exclusively. While ZMK Studio or another Studio client holds it, reads fail and the widget dims the last known levels.
- A read takes about 2 seconds. Each retry for a dropped relay entry adds about 2 more.
- Only two halves are expected by default. Use `--labels` for other layouts.

## Troubleshooting

**A half still reads low after charging.** Its latest history entry predates the charge.

- With `CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_SKIP_IF_USB_POWERED=y`, the default, halves record nothing on USB power. After unplugging, the next record comes within `CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, 5 by default.
- If it stays stale, the half may still report USB power. Power cycle it: the first record after boot is always saved.
- Build the halves with `CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_SKIP_IF_USB_POWERED=n` to record while charging too.

`timestamp` is seconds since the half booted. `1` means the entry was recorded at boot.
